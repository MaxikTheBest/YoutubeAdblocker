# ðŸ¥‡ GoldenAdblocker

A simple, effective, and completely free YouTube ad blocker.

 This tool works differently than typical blockers. It doesn't just hide or skip ads â€” it stops them from loading entirely.

**4. Restart your browser**

##  How It Works

This project skips the usual adblocker filter approach. Instead, it uses the 'embedded' player via a proxy iframe, which bypasses ad filters completely.  

It's fast, stable, and won't mess with your video playback.

##  FAQ

**Q: Do I need to update this?**  
A: No, this updates automatically. If you arenâ€™t getting the latest version automatically, hold `Ctrl` and press `F5` to force-reload the page.

**Q: Playlist skipping a few seconds**  
A: This is usually caused by a conflicting extension. Disable all other extensions, then enable them one by one to find the conflict.

**Q: I can't watch a specific video**  
A: Some videos wonâ€™t work because embedding is disabled by the uploader, it is age-restricted, or similar. Turn the script off for that video.

**Q: Extension compatibility**  
A: Most YouTube-related extensions arenâ€™t compatible. This uses the 'embedded' version of the YouTube player. Extensions that only modify page style may work.

**Q: Different problem**  
A: Likely caused by a conflicting extension. Turn off all extensions, then enable them one by one until you find the conflict.

**Q: How to make it work on mobile or tablet devices?**  
A: You need a browser that supports extensions (like Safari on tablet) and a userscript manager, or install the script as an extension manually. Tutorials are available online.

**Q: Why is the code obfuscated?**  
A: To protect my work and prevent others from copying it. Obfuscation allows the project to safely grow on its main page.

**Q: The Youtube player ui is different?**  
A: This brings back the old Youtube player UI because it uses the 'embedded' player version, which hasnâ€™t received (and probably wonâ€™t receive) the new UI updates that the main player has.

**Q: I don't see the mini-player icon**  
A: The mini-player is not supported. Instead, it uses the 'picture-in-picture' browser API, which works even better.

**Q: Some functionalities are missing**  
A: Not all YouTube functionalities are included in the 'embedded' player version, but almost all have been remade. Exceptions include:  
- Autoplay plays the next video immediately, not after 8 seconds  
- No Sleep Timer option  
- No Ambient Mode option  
- No Next Video preview when hovering over the 'Next' button  
- No Mini-Player  
- Possibly more features
